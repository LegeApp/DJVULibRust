1/29/26 update, coming back to it again - JB2, arithmetic, ZP now work. IW44 is the last puzzle.

DJVU Encoder only in Rust, not working, needs work in the following areas:
- Arithmetic encoder doesnt match up with original (most significant issue)
- JB2 encoder needs testing
- Masking and layering
- IW44 reverse transform
- Final document creation logic
